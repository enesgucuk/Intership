## A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning
#### As a rule of thumb, a dumb algorithm with lots and lots of data beats a clever one with modest amounts of it. (After all, machine learning is all about letting data do the heavy lifting.
#### The trend is toward larger and larger ensembles. In the Netflix prize, teams from all over the world competed to build the best video recommender system . As the competition progressed, teams found that they obtained the best results by combining their learners with other teamsâ€™, and merged into larger and larger teams. The winner and runner- up were both stacked ensembles of over 100 learners, and combining the two ensembles further improved the results.
#### After overfitting, the biggest problem in machine learning is the curse of dimensionality.
